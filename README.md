# PAGE: Python GUI Generator
## This repo is for demonstration purposes only


PAGE is a drag-and-drop GUI generator for Python and Tkinter which generates Python modules that display a relatively simple GUI constructed from Tk and ttk widget sets using the Place Geometry Manager.

PAGE is a cross-platform tool running on any OS which has a current version of Python installed. PAGE output requires only Python Tkinter and runs on Linux, Unix, Windows, OS X, and even Rasperian.

Version 7 is a major release employing a simplified code generation scheme while supporting multiple toplevel GUI's. Version 7 also drops Python 2 support.
